  - Runs all unit tests with code coverage
  - Validates code formatting
  - Uploads coverage reports to Codecov (optional)
  - Caches NuGet packages for faster builds

### üöÄ Release Workflow (`release.yml`)

- **Purpose:** Create releases with built artifacts
- **Features:**
  - Builds self-contained executables for Windows x64/x86
  - Creates MSI installers with WiX Toolset v6
  - Creates ZIP archives for distribution
  - Generates detailed release notes
  - Creates GitHub releases with artifacts
  - Supports both tagged releases and manual triggers

### üì¶ Dependency Updates (`dependency-updates.yml`)
**Trigger:** Weekly schedule or manual dispatch
- **Purpose:** Automated dependency management
- **Features:**
  - Monitors for NuGet package updates
  - Creates automated PRs for updates
  - Ensures dependencies stay current and secure
  - Gaming-library compatibility checking

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Repository Secrets (Required for CodeRabbit)
Add these secrets in your GitHub repository settings:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Required for CodeRabbit AI reviews (get from OpenAI)
- `CODECOV_TOKEN`: For code coverage reporting with Codecov.io (optional but recommended)

### 2. Branch Protection (Recommended)
Configure branch protection rules for `main` branch:
- Require status checks to pass before merging
- Require CodeRabbit review to pass
- Require CI workflow to pass  
- Require up-to-date branches before merging

### 3. CodeRabbit Configuration
CodeRabbit is automatically configured with:
- Gaming-specific rules for Elite Dangerous integration
- German language reviews
- WPF performance optimization checks
- HOTAS/Gaming hardware validation
- MSI installer security analysis

### 4. Release Process
To create a release:

#### Automatic (Recommended):
1. Create and push a git tag: `git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin v1.0.0`
2. The release workflow will automatically build MSI and ZIP artifacts

#### Manual:
1. Go to Actions tab in GitHub
2. Select "Release" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Enter the version (e.g., v1.0.0)
5. Click "Run workflow"

## ü§ñ CodeRabbit Integration Benefits

### Replaced Workflows
The following workflows were consolidated into CodeRabbit:
- ‚ùå `code-quality.yml` ‚Üí Now handled by CodeRabbit AI
- ‚ùå `security-scan.yml` ‚Üí Security analysis in CodeRabbit
- ‚ùå `security.yml` ‚Üí Integrated into CodeRabbit reviews  
- ‚ùå `dependency-check.yml` ‚Üí Dependency analysis in CodeRabbit

### Enhanced Features with CodeRabbit
- üéÆ **Gaming-Specific Analysis**: Elite Dangerous integration patterns
- üïπÔ∏è **Hardware Validation**: HOTAS/Joystick device support checks
- üõ°Ô∏è **Security-First**: Gaming tool security best practices
- üá©üá™ **Localized Reviews**: German language feedback
- ‚ö° **Performance Focus**: Gaming UI responsiveness optimization

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **CodeRabbit Reviews Missing**: Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in repository secrets

2. **MSI Build Fails**: WiX Toolset v6 is used - check setup/Build-MSI.ps1 for details

3. **Tests Fail**: All tests must pass locally before pushing. CI treats warnings as errors.

4. **Code Formatting Fails**: Use dotnet format before committing:
   - Run `dotnet format` to auto-format code
   - Commit formatted changes and push again

### Local Testing:
Before pushing, test locally:

```powershell
# Test formatting and build
dotnet format --verify-no-changes
dotnet restore  
dotnet build --configuration Release
dotnet test --configuration Release

# Test MSI creation (Windows only)
.\setup\Build-MSI.ps1 -Version "1.0.0-test" -SourcePath ".\src\EdBindings\bin\Release\net8.0-windows\"
```

### CodeRabbit Configuration:
- Main config: `.coderabbit.yaml`
- Gaming rules: `.coderabbit/config.yaml`  
- Custom prompts: `.coderabbit/prompts.md`
- Feedback template: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/coderabbit-feedback.md`

## Customization

You can customize these workflows by:
- Modifying trigger conditions
- Adding additional build configurations
- Changing artifact retention periods
- Adding notification integrations (Slack, Teams, etc.)
- Adding additional security scanners
