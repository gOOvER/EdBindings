* **Categories**: Filter by binding categories (Flight, Combat, Navigation, etc.)
* **VoiceAttack Integration**: Copy VoiceAttack variable names for voice command integration
* **Export**: Save filtered results or complete binding lists

### Finding Your Bindings File

Elite Dangerous stores binding files in:
```
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Frontier Developments\Elite Dangerous\Options\Bindings\
```

Common binding files:
- `Custom.3.0.binds` - Your custom bindings
- `Keyboard.binds` - Default keyboard layout  
- `GamePad.binds` - Default gamepad layout

## Device Mapping Files

1. The device mapping files are found in the `DeviceMappings` folder
2. The files are in JSON format using the following Schema:

```json
{
  "name": "{{Friendly Device Name, will appear in menu}}", 
  "controls": [
    {
      "deviceId": "{{The device from the ED binds file}}",
      "deviceName": "{{Friendly Device Name to show in the table}}",
      "controlLabel": "{{Friendly name for the key to show in the table}}",
      "controlValue": "{{The key value from the ED binds file}}"
    }
  ]
}
```

See [X56.json](https://github.com/gOOvER/EdBindings/blob/main/src/EdBindings/DeviceMappings/X56.json) for a complete example.
